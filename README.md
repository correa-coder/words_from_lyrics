With the goal of learning some vocabulary words in **Spanish**, I decided to create an app that extracts the words from a ``.txt`` file containing the lyrics for a song, it should work with **any** language, not just Spanish.

There are two ways to use this software, with a console interface by running the ``console.py`` file or with a GUI by running the ``main.py``.

> This software was created using Python 3.8
